# ReviewSiteV1

This is a fun project I chose for Code Louisville's .NET class. I wanted to find a way 
to perform some basic functionality similar to a review or blog site, while providing multiple 
view options for a potential user who only wanted to see a particular type of review. 

The site does not use traditional numbered reviews, but uploads images used as my views on
each piece I am reviewing. I included some options in the IMAGE_OPTIONS folder that has been
uploaded to Github.

Uses standard localdb settings, so should just work after compiling.

Home screen shows All Reviews
Separate tabs for specific review types

Admin link at far right gives options for creating each review type, which is accessed by hitting the 'Add' button. You can also click edit and remove using the buttons on the same page. All CRUD operations work as intented.
