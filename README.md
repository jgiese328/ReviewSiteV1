# ReviewSiteV1

This is a fun project I chose for Code Louisville's .NET class. I wanted to find a way 
to perform some basic functionality similar to a review or blog site, while providing multiple 
view options for a potential user who only wanted to see a particular type of review. 

The site does not use traditional numbered reviews, but uploads images used as my views on
each piece I am reviewing. I included some options in the IMAGE_OPTIONS folder that has been
uploaded to Github.
